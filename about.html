            <p>Educate Others, The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us how challenging it is for children in rural and
                semi-urban areas to access quality education, whether online or offline. The effect of the lockdown has
                brought education to a standstill for millions of rural children.

                Since 2011, eVidyaloka has been using technology to empower rural children by connecting passionate
                volunteers across the globe, online. While students in cities attend online classes from the comfort of
                their homes, most students across Rural India have limited access to Internet-enabled devices and
                teachers equipped to teach online.

                While we can reach students through our existing programs, there are still many children in danger of
                being pushed out of formal education, and the marginalized populations, as always, remain at a greater
                risk.

                In our endeavour to ensure that no child is deprived of learning, eVidyaloka is focusing on a
                multi-delivery approach to ensure more children are reached outside of the Digital Classroom Program, by
                piloting Digital School.
